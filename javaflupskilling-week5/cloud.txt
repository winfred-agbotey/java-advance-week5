âœ… A. Cloud Fundamentals (AWS or Azure)
1. Core Concepts of Cloud Computing:
Model	Description	Benefits for Java Apps
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)	Offers virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., EC2 on AWS)	Full control of OS and app stack, great for customizing Java runtime
PaaS (Platform as a Service)	Provides a platform allowing developers to build apps without managing infrastructure (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service)	Quick deployment, auto-scaling, no server maintenance
SaaS (Software as a Service)	Software apps hosted by a provider and available via the internet (e.g., Gmail, Office365)	Useful for third-party integrations into your app
Benefits for Java Applications:

Scalability: Auto-scale instances to handle more users/posts.

Elasticity: Scale up/down based on demand (e.g., weekend surges).

Cost-Effectiveness: Pay-as-you-go; no need for on-prem infrastructure.

2. Cloud Services for Social Media App (Using AWS):
Feature	AWS Service	Use in Social Media App
Compute	Amazon EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk	Host Java app (backend API)
Database	Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) or DynamoDB	Store user profiles, posts
Storage	Amazon S3	Store images, videos, profile pictures
Monitoring	CloudWatch	Monitor performance, set alarms
Security	IAM	Secure access to services and data
Deployment	CodeDeploy or Elastic Beanstalk	Easy deployment and versioning
